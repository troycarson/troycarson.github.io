Meteor is a free and open-source isomorphic JavaScript framework written in Node.js. Meteor enables rapid prototyping for applications 
across iOS, Android, and web-based applications. Meteor is integrated with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a 
publish-subcribe pattern to maintain any chages made on the developer end onto the client end without the need for careful synchronization.
On the client side, Meteor can be use with the Blaze templating engine as well as the Angular framework or React library for greater 
versatility and convinience of use.
