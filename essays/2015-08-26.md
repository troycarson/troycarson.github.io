The only languages that I had previously worked with are Java, C, and C++, although I am still not very comfortable with neither C nor C++ as I have only briefly worked with them for a single semester-long course.

JavaScript is significantly quicker than Java or C as acomplishing the same code can often be done with fewer key strokes -- even simple actions such as creating function headers or declaring variables. While I have greatly enjoyed learning JavaScript as its simplicity makes it very efficient to write code very quickly, it almost makes me feel dirty in a way. I recall back to my ICS 111 (Introduction to Computer Science I) class where we were learning Java, but my professor often mentioned JavaScript. The professor said that it was best to learn Java first as it was more of a proper language – he related it to English, and JavaScript was more of a pigeon dialect – as he related it to the common “Pidgin” dialect that many people local to the state of Hawaii use. JavaScript’s simplicity is very refreshing for me and has been a blast to learn, but I see why my professor argued that it was not the best language for first-time programmers as one would miss out on learning all the more spelled-out nuances, such as learning what “public static void main (String args[])” means as one develops his or her familiarity with Java.

The WODs I have done so far have been interesting micro-challenges that force me to solve a simple problem in a terse amount of time wich introduces a stress element that I do not usually have to contend with during coding sessions. I find that these challenges (so far at least) as appropriate and fair challenges for the content that we are responsbile for being familar with and are even quite fun as I enjoy solving exercise problems like these. I am eager to continue to use JavaScript and become not only a more proficient coder but also better understand what the language is capable of and how it is commonly used in real-world applications.
