"Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML."

I have only had a week's worth of work with Semantic UI, but I cannot imagine programming for the web without it. Having a UI 
Framework enables one to make sleek and professional-looking websites in a matter of hours. Whereas without Semantic UI, it will 
take me hours to produce a bland website that looks like it was developed in the early-2000s at best. 

Semantic makes it easy to create simple-to-complex websites with, as they advertsie, "human-friendly HTML". Making a class with the
name "ui borderless menu" or "ui three column grid container" is easily understood by the developer writing the code as well as 
someone reading over the HTML—it's English.

Semantic UI has a plethora of features that make it easy to design every component of a webpage—from the header to the footer. 
Semantic makes it easy to manipulate elements of any kind with easy-to-use functions that all for quick and dramatic personalization.
As far as I have seen, if I can imagine it, Semantic UI can do it. 

I have no real frame-of-reference. Semantic might be a terrible UI framework. However, as far as I can tell, Semantic is a leading 
option of web developers alongside the likes of bootstrap and ionic. Regardless of how they stack up, using a UI framework of this 
calibre makes front-end web design amazingly convenient and is practically essential for any serious project
