Manoa Rides is a carpooling application for the University of Hawaii community. Manoa Rides enables members of the University of Hawaii to pair drivers in search for riders, or riders in search of a driver, and create their own carpooling solutions.

Carpooling solves two problems, many people have difficult getting to and from campus and others who do drive would simply enjoy the convinence of carpooling benefits such as parking, HOV lanes, or maybe a snack from a gracious passenger.

Manoa Rides allows drivers and riders to easily find one another based off of proximity and when they would like to head to or from school. This is a completely free service and we encourage the users to negotiate with one another as to what a fair compensation for the drivers might be as they would be going out of their ways to pick up a passenger or two. Some drivers may be more than happy to do so for free, while others may ask for a few bucks for gas money, a small snack, or even a funny joke!

By limiting this service to members of the UH community every rider or driver is accountable and knownâ€”a UH email address is required to create an account. This exclusivity makes the expierence more trustable and safe for users.

Summarily, Manoa Rides aims to provide an organic and safe way to make the regimented process of getting to and from class easier for those within our community. We hope you find it useful!
