This was a surprisingly challenging project as a great deal of the requiornments for the project depending upon creating and formatting user interface elements. With my group members and me only recently being exposed to constructing intuitive and clean UI elements, we had to research and learn through a great deal of trial and error in order to achieve our standards of quality for how we wanted our game to look. The logic itself was also no small feat. We divided up specific functions among group members but we all ended up having a considerable amount of trouble and required a great deal of collaboration between group members before we finally finished our project. 

This was my second expierence with coding alongside others and so the idea of not having to do everything myself was still somewhat foreign to me. Working alongside others is an extremely important facet of computer science, as well as nearly all profesional disciplines, so garnering as many expierences as I can manage is fundamental for my growth and development as not only a coder, but as an efficient and corroborative worker.
