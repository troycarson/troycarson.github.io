As I have been a member of the Youth Philanthropy Board for several yeras now, the board is well aware of my technical interests and capabilities. With the desire for an official poster to be created and disseminated to better promote the organization and supply funding to more service-learning projects, I was asked to create a poster that could be used as a generic template that could be modified as needed to display contact or other information that is variable to change from year-to-year. 

I have had some exposure to Photoshop before undertaking this project, however, the making of this poster was a fantastic learning expierence for me to gain a better understanding of one of the staple utilites for graphic design. I was very pleased with what I was able to accomplish with this poster and hope to find similar projects in the near future to continue to develop and challenege my skill set whilst peaking my interest in graphic design.
